More to come

## About Me

I am a third year Ph.D. student in Statistics at The University of Hong Kong, advised by [Prof. Jianfeng Yao](https://jianfengyao.wordpress.com/) and [Dr. Chen Wang](https://saasweb.hku.hk/staff/stacw/web/).

## Research Interests
My current research mainly focuses on bridging Random Matrix Theory and econometrics theory, with an emphasis on instrumental variable models and panel data models. I am also interested in causal inference and its applications in bioinformatics.

## Working Papers
1. Anderson-Rubin test with many instruments, with Chen Wang and Jianfeng Yao, 2023
2. A note on assessing the strength of many weak instruments with multiple endogenous variables, with Chen Wang and Jianfeng Yao, 2023
3. Assessing the strength of many instruments with the first-stage F and Cragg-Donald statistics, with Chen Wang and Jianfeng Yao, 2023
4. A specification test for the strength of instrumental variables, with Chen Wang and Jianfeng Yao, 2023
5. Unified and robust Lagrange multiplier type tests for cross-sectional independence in large panel data models, with Zhaoyuan Li and Jianfeng Yao, 2023
6. Assessing Risk Spillovers with (Lasso) VAR for Expectile, with Hui-Ching Chuang, O-Chia Chuang and Zaichao Du, 2022

## Work In Progress
1. Testing endogeneity in high dimension, with Chen Wang and Jianfeng Yao
2. High dimensional mediation analysis in CRISPR data, with Dailin Gan
