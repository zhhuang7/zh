## Still developing...
More to come

## About Me
I am a third year Ph.D. student in Statistics at The University of Hong Kong, where I am privileged to be advised by [Prof. Jianfeng Yao](https://jianfengyao.wordpress.com/) and [Dr. Chen Wang](https://saasweb.hku.hk/staff/stacw/web/).

## Research Interests
My current research primarily focuses on high-dimensional econometrics and random matrix theory (RMT). I am currently working on instrumental variable models and large panel data models with tools from RMT. I am also interested in causal inference and its applications in bioinformatics.

## Working Papers
1. Anderson-Rubin test with many instruments, with Chen Wang and Jianfeng Yao, 2023 - [[paper]](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q4tcas0hs3s4915/20230228_AR_test_with_many_instruments.pdf?dl=0)
2. A note on assessing the strength of many weak instruments with multiple endogenous variables, with Chen Wang and Jianfeng Yao, 2023 - [[paper]](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r49e5s82095vhgj/Adjusted_F_multiple_p.pdf?dl=0)
3. Assessing the strength of many instruments with the first-stage F and Cragg-Donald statistics, with Chen Wang and Jianfeng Yao, 2023 - [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14423.pdf)
4. A specification test for the strength of instrumental variables, with Chen Wang and Jianfeng Yao, 2023 - [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14396.pdf)
5. Unified and robust Lagrange multiplier type tests for cross-sectional independence in large panel data models, with Zhaoyuan Li and Jianfeng Yao, 2022 - [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14387.pdf)
6. Assessing Risk Spillovers with (Lasso) VAR for Expectile, with Hui-Ching Chuang, O-Chia Chuang and Zaichao Du, 2022 - [[paper]](https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=271115095026087003013108010104106006017000060055059029121029115023089071096029114125100029055040112124009075031070117076124103119082082087053120019020127012078004088038034008121006083023031101114126001085091086075008066123127019006096094105087084029001&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE)
