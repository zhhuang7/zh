## About Me
I am a fourth year statistics Ph.D. student at The University of Hong Kong, where I am privileged to be advised by [Prof. Jianfeng Yao](https://jianfengyao.wordpress.com/) and [Dr. Chen Wang](https://saasweb.hku.hk/staff/stacw/web/).

## Research Interests
My current research primarily focuses on high-dimensional econometrics and statistics theory. I work on developing inference methods and theory for 
high-dimensional econometrics models with tools from random matrix theory and semi/nonparametric statistics, particularly in instrumental variable and panel data contexts. I am also working on empirical analysis of social and genetic networks using techinuqes from econometrics and deep learning.
