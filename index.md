## About Me
I am a fourth year statistics Ph.D. student at The University of Hong Kong, where I am privileged to be advised by [Prof. Jianfeng Yao](https://jianfengyao.wordpress.com/) and [Dr. Chen Wang](https://saasweb.hku.hk/staff/stacw/web/).

## Research Interests
My current research primarily focuses on high-dimensional econometrics and statistics theory. I work on developing inference methods and theory for 
high-dimensional econometrics models with tools from random matrix theory and semi/nonparametric statistics, particularly in instrumental variable and panel data contexts. I am also working on empirical analysis of social and genetic networks using techinuqes from econometrics and deep learning.

## Job Market Paper
Testing endogeneity with many endogenous variables, with Chen Wang and Jianfeng Yao - *Draft coming soon*

_Studying statistical and econometrics models with high-dimensional endogeneity is becoming a major concern in recent years. I investigate testing endogeneity in instrumental variable models with both moderately high-dimensional endogeneity and instruments. I do not assume sparsity on coefficients. Within this framework, I show that the celebrated Durbin-Wu-Hausman test generally has distorted size. I further propose a dimension-adaptive test and establish its asymptotic validity. I also analyze its performance in the presence of many invalid instruments. I conduct extensive numerical simulations to confirm its satisfactory performance in various settings._
