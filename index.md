## About Me

I am a third year Ph.D. student in Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at The University of Hong Kong, advised by [Prof. Jianfeng Yao](https://jianfengyao.wordpress.com/) and [Dr. Chen Wang](https://saasweb.hku.hk/staff/stacw/web/).

## Research Interests
My current research mainly focuses on bridging Random Matrix Theory and high dimensional econometrics theory, with an emphasis on instrumental variable models and panel data models. I am also interested in causal inference and its applications in bioinformatics.

## Preprints
1. Anderson-Rubin test with many instruments
2. Assessing the strength of many instruments with the first-stage F and Cragg-Donald statistics
3. A specification test for the strength of instrumental variables
4. Unified and robust Lagrange multiplier type tests for cross-sectional independence in large panel data models
5. Assessing Risk Spillovers with (Lasso) VAR for Expectile

## Working Papers
1. Testing endogeneity in high dimension 
2. High dimensional mediation analysis in CRISPR data
